# Segment and Separate

([Back](../README.md))

## Objective

Segment and separate information based on sensitivity of information.

## Key Considerations

- [ ] Isolate and secure cloud workloads based on the sensitivity of the data. Leverage landing zones that include pre-defined, secured, multi-account support to allow different workloads and teams to be onboarded in an automated manner.

## Validation

- [ ] Confirm that department has a target network architecture high level design and / or diagram with appropriate segmentation between network security zones.

  Confirm that the department has documented a landing zone conceptual architecture that will guide deployment of the cloud platform and associated services.

  Confirm that CSP segmentation features are leveraged to provide segmentation of Management, Prod, UAT, DEV, and test. (for example, use of subscription, instances or other cloud provider construct).

## Applicable Service Models

- IaaS, PaaS

## Proposed Timelines
