# Secure Endpoints

([Back](../README.md))

## Objective

Implement increased levels of protection for management interfaces.

## Key Considerations

- [ ] Implement access restrictions to ensure the use of trusted endpoint devices that are patched and managed, in accordance with GC Endpoint Management Configuration Requirements.

**Note:** Some service providers may offer configuration options to restrict endpoint device access. Alternatively, organizational policy and procedural instruments can be implemented to restrict access.

## Validation

- [ ] Confirm that administrative access to cloud environments are from approved and trusted locations (e.g. departmental IP space) that leverage GC-managed devices that enforce the GC endpoint management configuration requirements.

  Demonstrate access configurations and policies are implemented for devices.

## Applicable Service Models

- IaaS, PaaS, SaaS

## Proposed Timelines

- 30 Days
