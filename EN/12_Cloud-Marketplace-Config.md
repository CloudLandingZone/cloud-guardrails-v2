([Back](../README.md))

## Objective

Restrict Third-Party CSP Store or Marketplace software to GC-approved products.

## Key Considerations

- [ ] Confirm that the security contact information is populated with appropriate information to ensure that the CSP can relay security-related information directly to appropriate Information Security contacts within the organization.

## Applicable Service Models
