# Configuration of Cloud Marketplaces

([Back](../README.md))

## Objective

Restrict Third-Party CSP Marketplace software to GC-approved products.

## Applicable Service Models

- IaaS, PaaS, SaaS

## Mandatory Requirements

- Only GC approved cloud marketplace products are to be consumed. Turning on the commercial marketplace is prohibited.
- Ensure that software offered through the CSPs or CSP marketplace undergo a software assurance process to ensure that only approved products are consumed.

## Validation

- Confirm that third-party marketplace restrictions have been implemented.
- Confirm that the security contact information is populated with appropriate information to ensure that the CSP can relay security-related information directly to appropriate Information Security contacts within the organization.

## Additional Considerations

None
