# GC Cloud Guardrails

([Fran√ßais](#mesures-de-protection-du-nuage-du-gc))

This project will host the minimum guardrails as part of the GC Cloud Operationalization Framework. The users of this project will be Government of Canada employees deploying cloud-based workloads.

## Purpose

The purpose of the guardrails is to ensure that departments and agencies are implementing a preliminary baseline set of controls within their cloud-based environments.

## Summary - Initial 30 Days

A summary of the cloud guardrails to be implemented in the initial phase are identified in the table below:

| ID. | Cloud Guardrails                                                          |

<!-- The [applicable scope for the guardrails](EN/00_Applicable-Scope.md) for the guardrails are based on cloud usage profiles. -->

## Post 30 Days

Departments are expected to continue implementing the security requirements as outlined in:

- [Direction on the Secure Use of Commercial Cloud Services: Security Implementation Notice (SPIN)](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/cloud-services/direction-secure-use-commercial-cloud-services-spin.html)
- [Government of Canada Security Control Profile for Cloud-Based GC Services](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/cloud-services/government-canada-security-control-profile-cloud-based-it-services.html)

Departments should engage with their IT Security Risk Management teams to obtain advice and guidance on integrating security assessment and authorization activities as part of the implementation of the GC cloud environment. The [Government of Canada Cloud Security Risk Management Approach and Procedures](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/cloud-services/cloud-security-risk-management-approach-procedures.html) outlines activities for Departments to consider as part of the departmental risk management activities.
