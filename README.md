# GC Cloud Guardrails – BETA

([Français](#mesures-de-protection-du-nuage-du-gc))

## Introduction

In August 2019, the Government of Canada (GC) established the [GC Cloud Guardrails](https://github.com/canada-ca/cloud-guardrails). The [GC Cloud Guardrails](https://github.com/canada-ca/cloud-guardrails) are mandated under the [Directive on Service and Digital](https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32601) [Appendix G: Standard on Enterprise Information Technology Service Common Configurations](https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32713). The [GC Cloud Guardrails](https://github.com/canada-ca/cloud-guardrails) are a preliminary set of baseline security controls to ensure that the cloud service environment has a minimum set of configurations for the cloud environment.

Currently, the guardrails are going through an update cycle. The updated version is presented as GC Cloud Guardrails – BETA in this repo.

## Purpose

To seek industry feedback on GC Cloud Guardrails – BETA.

## Questions

The following are questions for industry:

1. Do you have any comments on the proposed update to the cloud guardrails?
2. Do you anticipate any challenges for customers in implementing, validating, and reporting on compliance for the proposed guardrails?
3. For SaaS, what is the recommended approach for validating the guardrails either manually, or ideally in an automated manner?

## Definitions

For this document the following definitions will be used:

- Mandatory requirements: A set of baseline security controls that departments must implement, validate, and report on in the first 30 business days.
- Additional considerations: Additional security controls that are highly recommended and should be taken into consideration. While these are not expected to be implemented within 30 business days, they include best practices that should be considered as departments progress with the establishment of their cloud-based environments.
